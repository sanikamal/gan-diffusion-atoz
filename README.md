## üìö Overview

This repository contains mini-projects covering various aspects of GANs and Diffusion Models, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Each project is presented as a Jupyter notebook and includes detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations to help you understand how GANs and Diffusion Models work and how to use them.

## üöÄ Getting started

To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory. Each notebook includes step-by-step instructions and code examples to run and experiment with.

## üìù Projects

### GAN

**Project 1: Basic GAN**

In this project, you'll learn the basics of GANs and build a simple GAN that generates images of handwritten digits. You'll also learn how to evaluate the performance of your GAN and how to generate new images.

**Project 2: Conditional GAN**

In this project, you'll learn how to build a conditional GAN that generates images of animals based on their species. You'll also learn how to use a pretrained classifier to guide the generation process and improve the quality of the generated images.

**Project 3: Wasserstein GAN**

In this project, you'll learn about Wasserstein GANs, a variant of GANs that use a different loss function to train the generator and discriminator. You'll build a Wasserstein GAN that generates images of faces and compare its performance to a traditional GAN.

**Project 4: StyleGAN**

In this project, you'll learn about StyleGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN architecture that can generate high-quality images with fine-grained control over the style and appearance. You'll build a StyleGAN that generates images of landscapes and experiment with different styles and settings.

### Diffusion

* [**Introduction to ü§ó Diffusers**](notebooks/introduction_to_diffusers.ipynb)
  
In this notebook, a diffusion model is trained to generate images of cute butterflies ü¶ã. This process will cover the core components of the ü§ó Diffusers library, laying a solid foundation for more advanced applications.[]()

**Project 6: Diffusion with Conditioning**

In this project, you'll learn how to condition diffusion models on additional inputs to guide the generation process. You'll build a conditioned diffusion model to generate images based on specific conditions or constraints.

**Project 7: Advanced Diffusion Techniques**

In this project, you'll explore advanced techniques in diffusion models, including enhancements and modifications to improve the quality and efficiency of the generated images. You'll implement and experiment with state-of-the-art diffusion methods.
