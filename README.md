## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a series of mini-projects that cover various aspects of GANs, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Each project is presented as a Jupyter notebook and includes detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations to help you understand how GANs work and how to use them.

The projects are organized in a logical order, starting with the basics of GANs and gradually building up to more advanced topics such as conditional GANs, Wasserstein GANs, and StyleGAN.
## 🚀 Getting started

To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory. Each notebook includes step-by-step instructions and code examples that you can run and experiment with.
## 📝 Projects
Project 1: Basic GAN

In this project, you'll learn the basics of GANs and build a simple GAN that generates images of handwritten digits. You'll also learn how to evaluate the performance of your GAN and how to generate new images.
Project 2: Conditional GAN

In this project, you'll learn how to build a conditional GAN that generates images of animals based on their species. You'll also learn how to use a pretrained classifier to guide the generation process and improve the quality of the generated images.
Project 3: Wasserstein GAN

In this project, you'll learn about Wasserstein GANs, a variant of GANs that use a different loss function to train the generator and discriminator. You'll build a Wasserstein GAN that generates images of faces and compare its performance to a traditional GAN.
Project 4: StyleGAN

In this project, you'll learn about StyleGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN architecture that can generate high-quality images with fine-grained control over the style and appearance. You'll build a StyleGAN that generates images of landscapes and experiment with different styles and settings.
